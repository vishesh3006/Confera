# Confera

In this project we will develop a Conference Management System  web application, Confera, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for our client side and NodeJS(ExpressJS) for our server side. We are using Sqlite for storing our database.

## The features of Confera are divided in four main categories - 
          Main Application, 
          Submission of papers,
          Reviewing and 
          Program management. 
          
The system will be used for mainly four categories of users - Organiser, Reviewee, Reviewer and Attendee. Separate signups and portals will be there for reviewee, reviewer and attendee. Organiser will have admin access.


## Functional Requirements:
   #### 1) Event Creation: The organiser portal has an option for event creation by entering event parameters like name, topic, theme, date etc.
   #### 2) Venue Booking System: The organisers will also be able to book venue if the event is to be performed in offline mode
   #### 3) Event Suggestion: The attendees and reviewees will be suggested future events based on the previously attended events.
   #### 4) Slot Allotment and Alert system to Reviewers: The submitted papers will be distributed to the reviewers using our designed algorithm and alert mail will be sent to the reviewer. 
   #### 5) Plagiarism Checker: This project also provides the feature for plagiarism checking which can be used by reviewers to get the complete plagiarism report.
   #### 6) Result Notification System: The final result for the paper, whether accepted or rejected, will be provided to the reviewee using email.
   #### 7) Tracking system for Selected Papers: The users can keep track of their selected papers which appear on their portal.
